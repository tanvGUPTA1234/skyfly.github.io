        <h1> What is Grafic Design</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), graphic design is defined as</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">“the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content.” In other terms, graphic design communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way. These visuals can be as simple as a business logo,
            or as complex as page layouts on a website.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and principles that make up design. Elements are used in conjunction or opposition with each other to create visually striking and impactful designs.

            <p style="font-size: large;">These graphic design elements include:</p>

            Color Form Line Shape Size Space Texture
            <p style="font-size: large;"> Graphic designers also adhere to the principles of design, which are essentially a set of guidelines that help a design achieve effective composition. These basic principles aid in creating balance and stability for the piece of work.
            </p>
            These graphic design principles include: Balance Contrast Emphasis Movement Proportion Rhythm You’ve heard the old saying that “rules are meant to be broken,” which can certainly ring true in this case. But a good graphic designer must first understand
            these principles before making the conscious decision to break them.</p>

        <h2>Types of grapfic Design</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">As mentioned earlier, there is no single graphic design meaning. Graphic design is composed of many fields and specializations, ranging from print and web design to animation and motion graphics. Graphic design offers opportunities and options
            for individuals of almost any interest.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">If you’d asked someone 30 years ago to define graphic design, their answer would have likely been focused on print-related examples like magazines, movie posters and advertisements. Now we’re living in the digital age, which has given birth to
            several new types of graphic design.</p>
        <h3>Website design </h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;">involves creating engaging and intuitive web pages for users. This includes overall layout, color scheme and navigation.</p>
        <h3>User experience (UX) design</h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;">is focused on ensuring a website or application is easy and satisfying to use. These designers emphasize value, usability, adoptability and desirability.</p>
        <h3>Motion graphics design</h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Motion graphics design—or animation—brings visual elements to life through special effects, TV shows, video games and movies.</p>
