    <h4>1 - Our team works on taxation like a product is taxed at 7% and actual tax should be 5%, if such cases are found by our team, we are claiming on market platform to get refund Are.

    <h4> 2- Our team also sees such charges whose fee rate is different in the card and charges something else from the seller. If our team finds such cases then we raise the claim from the marketplace</p>
