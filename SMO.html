        <h1>what about the SMO (social-media-optimization-smo)</h1>
    </center>
    <p style="font-size:x-large;">Search engine marketing (SMO) is a digital marketing strategy used to increase the visibility of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs). While the industry term once referred to both organic search activities such as search engine optimization
        (SEO) and paid, it now refers almost exclusively to paid search advertising. Search engine marketing is also alternately referred to as paid search or pay per click (PPC).

        <h2>Why is SMO important?</h2>

        <p>With an increasing number of consumers researching and shopping for products online, search engine marketing has become a crucial online marketing strategy for increasing a company’s reach. In fact, the majority of new visitors to a website find
            it by performing a query on a search engine. In search engine marketing, advertisers only pay for impressions that result in visitors, making it an efficient way for a company to spend its marketing dollars. As an added bonus, each visitor
            incrementally improves the website’s rankings in organic search results. Since consumers enter search queries with the intent of finding information of a commercial nature, they are in an excellent state of mind to make a purchase, compared
            to other sites such as social media where users are not explicitly searching for something. Search marketing reaches consumers at exactly the right time: when they are open to new information. Unlike the majority of digital advertising, PPC
            advertising is non-intrusive and does not interrupt their tasks. Results are immediate with SEM. It is arguably the fastest way to drive traffic to a website.

        <h2>How SMO works</h2>

        <p>Search engines use complicated algorithms to ensure the most relevant results are returned for each search, including location and other available information. In paid search advertising, sponsored ads appear at the top of and on the side of search
            engine results pages to gain more visibility and prominence than the organic results. Let’s say that you are a customer looking for a product or service online. You go to a search engine and type in your search terms (also known as keywords).
            In your search results page, you will come across various company ads whose keywords match the keywords in your search. These ads appear in prominent locations on the page – along with the other search listings that match your keywords. The
            paid listings are highly relevant to your specific search, making it likely that you will click on them. Now let’s take a look at how SEM campaigns work from the marketer’s perspective. SEM networks are self-serve operations. Once a marketer
            selects a network, they can get a campaign up within a short period of time. When setting up a campaign within an SEM network, the marketer is prompted to: Conduct keyword research and select a set of keywords related to their website or product
            Select a geographic location for the ad to be displayed within Create a text-based ad to display in the search results Bid on a price they are willing to pay for each click on their ad</p>
