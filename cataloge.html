        <h1>Cataloging</h1>

        <p>A product catalog is a type of marketing collateral that lists essential product details that help buyers make a purchasing decision. These details include product features, description, dimensions, price, weight, availability, colors, customer
            reviews and more. Our team does premium cataloging by doing market research so that maximum orders can be generated.</p>

        <p>A service catalog contains templates with specifications that define parameters and features of a service (such as bandwidth and speed). Compared to the product catalog, the service catalog describes product features in technical terms.</p>
